This folder contains the functions and codes for implementing the HT-eQTL method. 
The EM_MT.m is the main function for MT-eQTL model fitting.
The HT_pipeline.m is the main function for HT-eQTL estimation. 
The jointlik.m and MAposterior2_1.m are both necessary functions to ensure the above main functions can work properly.
The HT_Sim_demo.m contains a step-by-step walk-through of a simulation example. We demonstrate how to generate simulated Z statistics matrix, fit MT-eQTL and HT-eQTL, and compare different methods in terms of parameter estimation and eQTL discovery.
